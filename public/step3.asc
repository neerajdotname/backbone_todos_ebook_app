=== minimal backbone application

Here is a minimal Backbone.js application. This application does not do anything meaningful yet.

[source,javascript]
$(function(){
  window.AppView = Backbone.View.extend({});
  window.app = new AppView;
});


=== Explanation

There is a lot going on in this step. First lets look at `events` stuff.

[source,javascript]
events: {
  "keyup #new-todo": "showTooltip"
}

Above code could be read as when keyup event occurs at `#new-todo` then invoke function `showTooltip`. When `todos.js` is loaded then backbone will look at events code and will do the necessary work to do proper event bindings. However backbone needs a context to which the events will be bound. And to get that context backbone looks for key `el`. `el` stands for `element`. Note that it is second letter is `l` for 'letter` and it is not numeric `1`.

[source,javascript]
el: $("#todoapp")

=== snapshot

If you enter something in the todo input box and wait for 1 second then you will see toolship as shown in the picture below.
