If a user start typing in the input box and after entering something if the user waits for more than one second then a tooltip should be shown.

=== minimal backbone application

Here is a minimal Backbone.js application. This application does not do anything meaningful yet.

[source,javascript]
$(function(){
  window.AppView = Backbone.View.extend({});
  window.app = new AppView;
});


=== Explanation

There is a lot going on in this step. First lets look at `events` stuff.

[source,javascript]
events: {
  "keyup #new-todo": "showTooltip"
}

Above code could be read as when keyup event occurs at `#new-todo` then invoke function `showTooltip`. When `todos.js` is loaded then backbone will look at events code and will do the necessary work to do proper event bindings. However backbone needs a context to which the events will be bound. And to get that context backbone looks for key `el`. Hence you will notice following code.

[source,javascript]
el: $("#todoapp")


In the jQuery world we are used to doing DOM manipulation without preceding the call with `this`. However in backbone you will see a lot of code like this

[source,javascript]
initialize: function(){
  this.input = this.$("#new-todo");
}

Get used to writing `this.$()` instead of just `$()` . That is because of the way backbone is architected.

Last but not the least you will notice method `initialize` . As the name suggests before any method is invoked initialize is invoked. Any prepatory code should be put here.


=== snapshot

If you enter something in the todo input box and wait for 1 second then you will see toolship as shown in the picture below.
