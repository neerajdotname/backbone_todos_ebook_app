=== Explanation

When Todos.create is invoked then Todo item is stored in localstorage.

Enter a Todo item and then press Enter. The Todo item is stored but you donâ€™t see the newly added item. This is because we need to build the view to display the stored data. This task will be completed in an upcoming step.
