=== Explanation

When a user hits enter after entering a Todo item then that Todo item needs to be stored. Here that Todo item is acting like a model. So this is a good item to create that model and then we will be able to save that model easily. A collection is nothing else but a collection of models.

=== Model Code

Below, code is creating a model named _Todo_ .

[source,javascript]
window.Todo = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    content: "empty todo ..."
  },
  initialize: function(){
    if (!this.get('content')){
      this.set({"content": this.defaults.content});
    }
  }
});


=== Collection Code

Here is Collection Code:

[source,javascript]
window.TodoList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Todo
});
window.Todos = new TodoList;

After this code `Todos` will refer to the collection. A backbone collection has certain properties. One of them is a method called http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Collection-create[create]. In order for `create` to work, collection needs to know which model to work with. Hence the attribute _model_. If creation of the model is successful then that newly created model will be added to the Collection.

If you run the code at this point of time you will get following error:


=== Error

[source,javascript]
Uncaught Error: A "url" property of function must be specified.


We are getting that error because when model is saved then backbone invokes http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Sync[Backbone.Sync] which attempts to save the record on the server. Since we have not specified how the model should be saved we are getting an error message.
