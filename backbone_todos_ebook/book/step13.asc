=== Explanation

This commit adds the feature of editing and updating a Todo item by double clicking an existing Todo item.

Let's look at the following code:

[source,javascript]
this.input.bind('blur', _.bind(this.close, this));

In the above code while binding we had to use `_bind` method provided by underscore to maintain the value of this. In this case following code would not work because providing `this` as the third argument only works while binding to Backbone events. More information about "bind" and "bindAll" is available http://blog.bigbinary.com/2011/08/18/understanding-bind-and-bindall-in-backbone.html[here] .

[source,javascript]
this.input.bind('blur', this.close, this);
