=== Explanation

This commit adds the feature of editing and updating a todo item by double clicking an existing todo item.

Let's look at following code.

[source,javascript]
this.input.bind('blur', _.bind(this.close, this));

In the above code while binding we had to use `_bind` method provided by underscore to maintain the value of this. In this case following code would not work because providing `this` as the third argument only works while binding to backbone events.

[source,javascript]
this.input.bind('blur', this.close, this);
