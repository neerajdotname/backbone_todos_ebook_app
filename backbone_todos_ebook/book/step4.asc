== Step 4 : Capture Event when Enter is Pressed

After typing the Todo task user is expected to hit Enter to save the task. In this step we wil try to just capture the event.

=== Explanation

In this commit, function `createOnEnter` is invoked everytime a key is pressed. However, we are only interested when `Enter` key is pressed.

[source,javascript]
createOnEnter: function(e) {
  if (e.keyCode != 13) return;
  console.log("add functionality to save the todo item");
  this.input.val('');
}
