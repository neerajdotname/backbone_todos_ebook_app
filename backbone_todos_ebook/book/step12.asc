=== Explanation

When a user clicks delete image to delete a todo item then function `clear` is invoked. This function destroys the model. When a model is destroyed then model invokes a callback bound to name `destroy`. In the initialize method an event binding is done such that when a model is destroyed then `remove` method is invoked.

In the `remove` method `this.el` is used to delete the view fragment. Note that in view `this.el` refers to the view fragment.
