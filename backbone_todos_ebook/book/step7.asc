=== Explanation

When a new todo item is created and added to the collection then collection fires an event called `add`. In this commit a callback function named `addOne` is being added. When a new item is added to the collection then this callback is fired.

In the following code the third argument is specifying what should be the value of `this` inside the function `addOne` .

[source,javascript]
Todos.bind('add', this.addOne, this);
