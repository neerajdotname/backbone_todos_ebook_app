=== Explanation

In this commit TodoView is created. This view is responsible for rendering the view from the template. Function `addOne` uses the view to append the view to the list.

After adding a few Todo items, you will see that the new Todo items are not displayed even if you hit Refresh. In the next step, we will fix that.
